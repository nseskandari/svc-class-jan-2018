    <h2>Located in the Mojave Desert of Joshua Tree California is a strange and otherworldly sight for the eyes. </h2>
    <h3>Out in this sparse and beautiful landscape there and over 10 acres of land there are over 100 art objects, many of which are large scale assemblages.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>In the late 1980s, after 11 years of public policy work for the California Arts Council, where Purifoy initiated programs such as Artists in Social Institutions, which brought art into the state prison system, Purifoy moved his practice out to the Mojave desert. 
        He lived for the last 15 years of his life creating ten acres full of large-scale sculpture on the desert floor. Constructed entirely from junked materials, this otherworldly environment is one of Californiaâ€™s great art historical wonders. 
        Below are some striking examples. </p>
